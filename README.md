# PokeScope
A small Pokemon Horoscope Widget.

Adding this app as a widget shows you a different random Pokemon every day, like a horoscope.

Fair warning: it is kind of a mess rn. It has a lot of redudant code in the app vs. the widget, and the app doesn't do much right now, it just shows you 10 random pokemon and their descriptions. I may come back to this project later to clean it up, and these are the top priorities if I did so:

TODO:
* Add detail views for Pokemon in app (and deep link widget to point to the detail view of the pokemon it's showing)
* Search functionality in app
* Better evolution graphic in case of complicated evolutions like Eevee
* Show statistics in large-style widget since there's a lot of empty space
